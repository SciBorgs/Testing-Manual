## What is Telemetry?
Telemetry is the gathering, sending, and receiving of data. The data usually includes information about how software is functioning. In the context of robotics, telemetry generally reports on the current state and/or performance of mechanisms, among other things.

WPILib supports the recording and sending of telemetry data in many different ways.

## Network Tables
Network Tables are a implementation of a distributed dictionary.

## On-Robot Telemetry
WPILib supports the recording of telemetry data directly on the robot's roborio.
