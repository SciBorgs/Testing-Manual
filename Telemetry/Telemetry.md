## What is Telemetry?
Telemetry is the gathering, sending, and receiving of data. The data usually includes information about how software is functioning. In the context of robotics, telemetry generally reports on the current state and/or performance of mechanisms, such as the PID values of a PID controller, amongst other relevant data.

WPILib supports the recording and sending of telemetry data in numerous ways. This guide will provide insight on the NetworkTables protocol, the telemetry methods built into WPILib (ex. `DataLogManager`, `Sendable`), and the usage of OBlog, a logging library. All of these methods incorporate telemetry into your robot code, which will prove to be a essential factor when debugging.
