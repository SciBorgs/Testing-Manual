### What is SysID?

SysID is a built in feature in wpilib that allows us to effectively generate tune PID [insert link when made] and SVA [insert link when made] values.

(MORE SPECIFIC DESCRIPTION OF WHAT IT DOES)

### Installing SysID

(ADD INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS & LINK)

### How do you use SysID? (General Mechanism)

1. Open SysID by typing SysID into the your search bar 
2. Go to the generator tab and put your team number under team/IP 
3. There are different modes for different mechanisms. We will only focus on Drivetrain and general mechanism sysID (FLAG)
4. For the motor controller section as of 2022/2023 put the motor controller as Spark Max(Brushless), set inverted if the motor is meant to be inverted and for the CAN ID just put the ID found on the Spark Max connected to the motor for the mechanism you are testing. Add extra motors with the plus if the mechanism uses more motors.
5. In the encoder section put encoder port if you unless you are using CanCoders(if we buy them)
6. Under encoder parameters set the gearing to whatever the gear ratio is for the mechanism(if it doesnt work try to switch it around) For counts per revolution set it to the value 8192 if you are using throughbores or 1 if you are using integrated Neo encoders and look up counts per revolution if you are using another encoder.
7. Now under logger go to project parameters for mechanism set it to the mechanism you are using for example hopper is elevator intake and flywheel are under simple
8. For unit type use whatever unit you are using and set units per rotation to see the distance went for rotation and use rotation only if the mechanism is 1 to 1.
9. Voltage Parameters, this represents the voltage applied during tests set the parameter for slide the slider to whatever voltage ramp rate you want for precise or very breakable mechanisms like hood set both quasistatic low and dynamic step voltage low as well. Low Voltage also tends to be more accurate.
10. To test on the robot plug in the laptop with the SysID setup. Set logger mode to enabled click apply if NT Connected is shown to the right of it click deploy under team/ip in generator choose a save location on your computer ideally in the sysID folder in the cloned respository run all your tests. Click save now you have your data.
11. To analyze your data go to analyzer select the sysID data from the folder you stored it run the analyzer and get the Feedback and Feedforward analysis note Feedback will yield PID values and Feedforward will yield SVA values.
12. Once you get your data now you have PID and SVA Values.

### SysID for Drivetrain

    4. In loggers go to motor controllers Set your motor controllers to Spark Max
     Brushless and choose which side of motors are inverted and for encoders use the encoder we are using whether it be CanCoders, Integrated Neos or whatever. Assuming we use swerve with CanCoders Invert one side of the cancoders
    5. For Gyro set the gyro to pigeon get the CAN ID and as of 2022/2023 we do 
    not have talons
    6. Encoder Parameters, the counts per revolution on a CanCoder is 4096 Counts 
    Per Revolution and Gearing is just the gear ratio of where the encoder is mounted
    7. Go to Logger and project parameters have mechanism as Drivetrain and Unit 
    Type as meters and set the Units Per Rotation as the circumfrence of the wheel
    8. Set up your voltage parameters lower values more precise values but don't 
    be afraid to go wild as long as you have a lot of space
    9. Basically follow the rest of the steps from SysID for General Mechanisms
